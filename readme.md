### About Me

I love technology and I love building things. I love solving real world problems. I build technology(and code) as a solution to a problem and not just merely as technology.

I have background in aerospace engineering ( bachelors and a masters ) and I like ✈ aircrafts, 🚗 cars, 🚢big boats and 🚀rockets.

Kudos

May the code be with you ⌨
