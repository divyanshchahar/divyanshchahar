### About Me

I love technology and I love building things. I love solving real world problems. I build technology(and code) as a solution to a problem and not just merely as technology.

I have background in aerospace engineering ( bachelors and a masters ) and I like âœˆ aircrafts, ðŸš— cars, ðŸš¢big boats and ðŸš€rockets.

Kudos

May the code be with you âŒ¨
