### About Me

I like building things but I won't be making the modern day Mona Lisa any time soon. I love building solutions. I see software as a solution and not merely as code.

I have background in aerospace engineering ( bachelors and a masters ) and I like âœˆ aircrafts, ðŸš— cars, ðŸš¢big boats and ðŸš€rockets.

Kudos

May the code be with you âŒ¨
